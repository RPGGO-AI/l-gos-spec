# General LLM-based Game Open Schema (L-GOS)

The vision of RPGGO is to democratize game creation together with UGC creators. This means that UGC creators have full copyright ownership of their games and the freedom to transfer them to any third-party platform.

This project aims to define an open data schema that any third-party LLM gaming platform can easily support and be compatible with. This way, UGC game creators can import and run their games on any third-party LLM gaming platform.

Only with the support of more and more third-party platforms can a truly decentralized gaming ecosystem emerge. Let's work together toward this goal!

## 📑 Introduction

Briefly, the schema contains 3 levels:
- Game, the data structure for running a complete game with LLM. One game can contain many characters.
- Character, the data structure for runnig a single character with LLM. One character can contain many modules
- Module, like Lego blocks, designed to enhance the expression and performance of characters and the game itself.
