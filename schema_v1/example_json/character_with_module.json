                    "content": "# ![][image1] The Text-To-OpenWorld Engine\n\n---\n\n# One-sentence\n\nAs a technology firm, we are leveraging generative AI to build the next generation text-to-openworld engine, enabling players to live an adventure with a new form of online interactive experiences. \n\n# What AI Town is missing?\n\nRecently, a16z's release of AI Town（[https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town](https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town) ） has garnered significant attention, prompting many to consider how its natural conversational features could inspire the next generation of interactive products.  \n![][image2]\n\nAnd from a product perspective, there are some significant shortcomings in its consumer experience. For instance:\n\n* The world lacks a supporting 'world guide book,' meaning there's no overarching storyline directing or driving the world, no objectives tied to that storyline, and no character interactions. This results in a lack of value in content consumption.  \n* The NPCs (Non-Player Characters) lack intelligence, detailed character design, and conversational abilities, making the overall dialogue feel less authentic and story-driven.  \n* The visual assets are preset styles rather than generative, leaving no room for user-generated content (UGC).  \n* The scale is small, with only 10 characters, and lacks large-scale social scenarios.  \n* Operational costs are high, around $50 per hour, averaging $6 per NPC per hour, making it difficult to commercialize.  \n* etc.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, it remains a milestone creative product. It opens up a new pathway for the next generation of open worlds—Text to Open World, a new form of UGC interactive world  sitting on generative AI.\"\n\n# Text to Open World\n\nExisting open-world products are abundant, whether they are metaverse social products or pixelated games like Roblox. However, these products face a challenge: they struggle to evolve into universal UGC (User-Generated Content) platforms. This is because their world guide book and asset styles are official, but not open, diverse, or conducive to UGC, limiting them to  vertica user bases. While these bases are highly engaged, this engagement doesn't easily generalize across different user groups. The advent of generative AI offers a viable solution to these traditional shortcomings in open-world games. It fills the gaps in world-building and creative freedom for assets.\n\nFrom a functional standpoint, generative AI brings transformative features:\n\n* Text to Story: Real-time logical reasoning for text generation allows AI to create world guide books.  \n* Text to Assets: Real-time graphic rendering translates text into visuals, personalized according to user-defined styles, scenes, and elements. While 3D generation still has a long way to go, 2D is already feasible.\n\nBehind these features, the most significant change may be in the production relationships, \n\n**shifting creative threshold downward.**   \nThis enables an open world based on UGC, personalized construction, and decentralized governance.\n\nLooking ahead to the next generation of open worlds, without getting into implementation details, they should at least include the following elements:\n\n* World Guide Book, including storylines, characters, world objectives, and core conflicts.  \n* Personalized NPCs, including customized voices, behaviors, language styles, appearances, and clothing.  \n* Visual Rendering, including 2D and 3D forms of characters, scenes, props, and materials.  \n* Consumer-Level AI Infrastructure, reducing the daily cost per user to under $1 for scalability.  \n* Decentralized Finance, including payments, asset trading, and financial systems.\n\nThese elements \\#1， \\#2， \\#3， \\#4 form the basic building blocks of Text-to-Open World.\n\nSo, what's different in user behavior and consumer mindset in this new generation of open worlds? \n\n* Imagine a game experience tailored just for you, where the entire world unfolds before you, and your actions in the game influence the storyline in real-time, NPCs remember your choices and react accordingly  \n* Assets are customized to your imagination, not limited by official constraints. The assets you create can be traded or sold, not just within one game but across an entire universe of interconnected experiences.  \n* The gaming experience is infinite and non-repetitive, with AI balancing individual and collective harmonization.   \n* The game itself becomes consumable UGC content, shareable and open to secondary creations.   \n* Immersive integration and autonomous NPC dialogues transport you into a 'Ready Player One' type of alternate world for chatting and interaction.\"\n\nThis is the future we envision, a future where the lines between gaming, social interaction, and content creation are blurred, thanks to the power and potential of generative AI. \n\nIn this new paradigm, the game is not just a game; it's a living, breathing ecosystem. It's a platform for creativity, social interaction, and even economic activity. We're not just talking about a technological shift; We believe it is  a cultural revolution.\n\n# What we are trying to do \n\nIn our startup, we aim to address these gaps by leveraging advanced generative AI to build the next Text-To-OpenWorld Engine and power the ability of UGC to create and play in his/her open world.  \nWe believe that the future of gaming and interactive products lies in the seamless integration of generative AI, and we're excited to lead the way.\n\n[![][image3]](https://app.diagrams.net/?page-id=p4CrAQctbnr0sls2vtrU&scale=auto#G1CeSJLLmh14IJO_rE045X_USo5auUtcGb)\n\nFor the Zagii engine, the core features include but are not limited to:\n\n* Fine-tuning based on open-source models with annotated RPG data to teach the AI how to create RPG games.  \n* Multi-LLM-model ensemble architecture, or what we call 'llm-augmented autonomous agents architecture.' Different large models take on different tasks and roles based on their unique capabilities during the generation process.  \n* RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), which utilizes a search framework to employ an external knowledge graph and meta-documents as search index, building prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context.  \n* Fast visual rendering: customized stable diffusion needs to generate an image within 2 seconds.\n\n\\*Among these, the annotation of RPG data and fine-tuning of open-source models will require significant resource and computational power investments. \n\nThis is the technological foundation we're laying, and it's not just ambitious; it's feasible. We're not just dreaming big; we're executing a scalable plan to make those dreams a reality.  Achieving the ultimate form all at once is unrealistic. There will be an iterative path. We will start by supporting the creation of one-dimensional, small-scale open worlds—specifically, 'murder mystery' scenarios—as a stepping stone to gradually build our AI-OpenWorld capabilities.\n\nBut please note that we are **NOT** building one RPG game, but building an AI-Engine to generate RPG games.  \n[![][image4]](https://app.diagrams.net/?page-id=-g0r8HuI3dDNgl5cUNwY&scale=auto#G1CeSJLLmh14IJO_rE045X_USo5auUtcGb)  \nIn the short term, our focus will be on optimizing our engine for these smaller-scale experiences, which will allow us to fine-tune our algorithms, validate our MVP product, and build a strong user base. These 'murder mystery' scenarios are not just a proof of concept; they are a viable product in their own right, with a dedicated following in the gaming community. They will serve as our initial market entry point, generating revenue and user engagement that will fuel our longer-term ambitions.\n\nAs we scale, we plan to expand into more complex and multidimensional open worlds. Imagine worlds where the storyline evolves in real-time based on collective user actions, where the economy is player-driven, and where the visual and narrative assets are as rich and dynamic as any game on the market today.\n\n# MVP Product\n\nWe are currently in the first phase of our engine and product development. The below demo tries to give a  sense of what kind of product can be built on top of our engine.\n\n![][image5]  \n Please access this link for demo video: [**RPGGO-official-trailer.mp4**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AxzhX4ElzuXQvnYFdqq0J53jANQ2AtKz/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe primary focus of our Phase 1 is to create a one-dimensional open world based on Discord, with several key features:\n\n* Discord-based product: We believe that the conversational experience is the most suitable and easily refined form for interacting within a text-based world.  \n* Daily cost per user under $1: We achieve this through a hybrid structure of multiple customized open-source LLM models and GPT, along with prompt vectorization, to make   \n* commercialization feasible.  \n* Limited-size one-dimensional world: In each world, the number of NPCs plus users will not exceed 10 ppl. Too much NPC interaction would bring new challenges in managing the memory stack, which we plan to address in the next version.  \n* More nuanced game details and smarter NPC experiences: We enhance AI capabilities by customizing multiple open-source models and training them with game data. And the model's capabilities will continue to improve.\n\nIn terms of capability elements, the yellow section represents the specific scope of the product we are releasing this phase. Think of it as a small-scale RPG 'murder mystery' scenario, but with the basic forms and elements of an open world. This can be further expanded as data and AI models evolve.\n\nWe will also release simple production tools that allow creators to quickly customize their story worlds and share them with friends, making your world easily shareable and initialized.\n\nThe alpha testing will start  in late September. While the product has various shortcomings that require ongoing optimization, we are excited about this new gaming experience and believe it will bring users entirely new feelings and expectations.\n\n# What’s the version after MVP？\n\nWe anticipate a four-month timeline to move Phase 1 from alpha to release. The second version's alpha is expected to follow approximately six months later. This version will include a significant iteration: Text-to-2D rendering. This feature will enable the real-time generation of open-world products based on a small-town structure.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to upgrade our tools to make it even easier for users to create their own small-town worlds and storybooks.\n\n# Why us?\n\nWe're at a pivotal moment in the evolution of interactive media, and we have the right mix of technical expertise, industry experience, and visionary leadership to seize this opportunity. \n\n* A first-class technical team with backgrounds from Facebook, Tencent.  \n* Proven experience in platform-based products, and content-oriented products in the global market.  \n* Bi-cultural team with both American and Chinese backgrounds, combining global product success with a deep understanding of user growth strategies.  \n* And most importantly, we are driven by a passion for technological innovation in the open world and a vision that believes in the value of User-Generated Content (UGC).\"\n\n# At the end\n\nWith this doc, we aim to instill a sense of urgency and excitement about the groundbreaking work we're doing. We're not just another startup; we're a revolution waiting to happen, and this is the chance to be part of it.\n\nFeel free to contact us at codingtmd.eth@rpggo.ai  \n![][image6]  \n\n",

                    "content": "# RPGGO 是哪一年成立的？团队规模目前有多大？RPGGO 的愿景是什么？\nWhen was RPGGO founded? How big is the team and where are they based? What is RPGGO’s vision? \n\nRPGGO was founded on August 2023 with a vision - \"Enrich simple thoughts to exhilarating adventures\n- 让简单有趣的创意成为激动人心的冒险\".  As a high-tech startup, we target a future of next-generation text-to-game engines. Where everyone can start from an idea, and then AI serves as the game engine to generate storylines, characters, plots, lores, and game objectives, including text and visuals, players can take on any role to explore this virtual world, interact with various intelligent characters, as if the characters in this virtual world are real, experience a different game experience, which is similar to an HBO TV series called \"Westworld\". We believe in UGC power and dedicate ourselves to breaking the chains that imprison creativity in UGC creators, and liberating productivity to transform creative ideas into RPG games. \n\nRPGGO starts its office with 7 people at the beginning. After we published the roadmap and early products, more people with the same beliefs joined us. We expanded to 15 people in the past half, including Design, PM, Operation, Research, and Engineering,  dispersed across the United States,  China, and the United Kingdom, who are passion-driven as fans and enthusiasts of UGC narrative drive game creation and Anime, Comics and Games from a worldwide cultural perspective. \n\nConsidering that we are trying to solve a brand new challenge introducing the AIGC into Game real-time generation as a revolution,  seeking individuals with an innovative spirit and a capacity for breakthrough thinking is crucial for the composition of the team. So when establishing our team, the founder team is committed to keeping our team small and efficient, but with high creativity, critical thinking, and cutting-edge technical capabilities. And especially in the early stage of AI, technology is a very important competitiveness for each startup. Fortunately, we have the top-level algorithm experts and engineers in the world and their proficiency makes the team able to tackle challenges head-on.\n\nWith this great team, we expect our products to carry our original aspiration - convert UGC from being passive consumers to active creators and provide brand-new interactive and personalized game experiences for players.\n\n\n# 使用生成式人工智能制作RPG角色扮演游戏的想法是如何产生的？\nHow did the idea to use generative AI to build role-playing games come about? \n\nSome of us were working in Tencent during the time that the idea emerged, and there was a proposition we kept challenging ourselves since 2020 \"How can we let everyone build fun experiences?\". In the past ten years, we saw the trend of creation shifting from PGC to UGC in text(like publication to web novel), and media (long-form video to short-form video), and each time, UGC's capability and ideas have been further amplified and enlarged, bringing forth an unprecedented amount of new and exciting content and experiences emerged into the market. So, \"How about interactive playable experiences such as games?\" We foresaw that the shifting of creation from PGC to UGC would be the next big thing in games since 2020, but we didn't see a feasible path at that time. As you see, generative AI rose at the beginning of 2022 and changed everything since then. We were sure in the middle of 2023 that \"yes, the path is there\". Now, we aim to democratize the creation of games. \n\nWe chose Role-Playing Game (RPG) as our product angle since we believe generative AI will bring a completely different intricate experience here. Building games will not be the same as in the past, such as  determining the rules, paths, and codes of professional developers, the creator is the player at the same time, and creation is a playable experience by using natural languages in chat form and giving commands in words, where the UGCs are the designers who determine the sphere and the boundary of NPCs and plots instead of writing codes. In addition, unlike traditional Non-Player Characters, which lack soul and connection with the Player, the next generation of generative AI can have interesting personalities and strong enough intelligence to interact with real humans as in parallel worlds, the narrative grows as the experience moves forward. This will be an important differentiation compared with traditional games.\n\nBut, \"why such PGC to UGC trends didn't happen in RPG games before?\".  Because RPG games require specialization in more areas than one person can manage. To be able to build an RPG (even at the UGC level), you need to be a master in screenwriting, narrative design, character design, reward design, visual drawing, code programming, etc, which is impossible for individual creators.\n\nSo, will \"build a game from a few words\" be a cool idea? The founder team feels excited about this direction since we are UGC believers. Thinking about a UGC creator, like you and me, comes to a platform and inputs some simple text to roughly describe the idea, and then the AI will auto-generate the storyline, character, chapter, goal, etc as a game sketch, it is powered by the AI logic and lively hosting the interactive game experience intelligently and responsively. This approach breaks down the barriers between idea and execution, enabling creators to focus on storytelling and game design without getting bogged down in the technicalities of game development. Once a person starts the game, the game engine starts to render the game sketch with details in real-time and to let the player feel in a real parallel world via a multi-agent, bi-interactive, and deep immersive experience. That will be unimaginable brilliance!  As a UGC creator, you don't need to learn anything new, but get a chance to utilize your imagination.\n\nThe most important thing is, when we talk about RPG, we are looking for a new interactive experience, which is a bit different from traditional RPG experience, fixed story, rule-based, with no soul for each role and little participation in determining the fate and world. In a long view, we believe \"create, play, and impact will all happen at the same moment by anyone\", So, “immersive” and \"dynamic\" are the keywords in our product philosophy. It means the game is not on a fixed game path, but anything a player does in the game will have an impact on how AI engines generate the next scene towards the game goal. So, this is a dynamic game experience with personalization which does not exist in traditional games.\n\nCurrently, we built the AI game engine to render games in real-time and also released a creator tool as the copilot to help talent creators build games. Shortly, our one-click text-to-game generation tool will come up and anyone can create a game as simple as how he/she creates an AI image today. What a wonderful world it will be!\n\n\n# RPGGO现在有多少用户和创作者，来自哪些国家？RPGGO 在资金或用户群方面有什么目标吗？\nHow many users and creators does RPGGO have now, and which countries do they come from? Does RPGGO have any goals in terms of funding or user base?\n\nWe launched Alpha testing in Feb for one month and got lots of feedback. We saw thousands of creators and tens of thousands of users entering our product during the Alpha testing. The majority of them are from the United States, Europe, and Japan. Both the creator and player have a clear profile picture. Creators include web novel writers, anime VTubers, fanart creators, etc. For players, are mostly ACG fans, DND fans, and Roblox players, and quite some of them are high school students, which says that the younger generation is more adapted to this new form of AI-native product. \n\nEven though we haven't reached the ideal product form as we planned, we already saw strong engagement from the end players. With all the feedback collected from Alpha testing, this May, we will start to roll out our Multi-modal game experience, with  \"dynamic\" and \"immersive\" experiences, which we believe will significantly improve the game experience and help us to grow users in Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia. We define ourselves as a social game platform, so social media will be an important user growth source for us.\n\n\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do.\" We look forward to investors/advisors/individual contributors with an adventurous spirit and a similar vision for the next generation of gaming revolution joining our adventure, which we believe is also an interesting RPG game in real life.\n\n",
