# Compatible with SillyTavern Card

For sillytavern and some other 3rd party softwares, they are using https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2, which has many similarity in character, but lacks support for game and module.

Highly recommend to use L-GOS Spec which has more flexibity to extention. But if you already have legacy asset in character-card-spec-v2, this project offer you the tool to convert between L-GOS and character-card-spec-v2.
